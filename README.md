## Augmented Reality-Assisted N queens

The `n` queens problem is the task of placing `n` queens on an `n`x`n`, `n`=/=2,3 chessboard such that no 2 queens are challenging each other. This is a well-studied chess puzzle and has seen much attention by mathematicians since the puzzle's definition.

This project is an augmented-reality driven visual aid for solving the `n` queens problem on an `8`x`8` chessboard. 

Using board detection and orthorectification alongside a CNN binary classifier, this project correctly identifies chessboard and piece layout with 36% accuracy.
